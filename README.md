# Overview
The project involves designing and implementing a relational database for a vet clinic to improve their spreadsheet and pdf-based pet booking system.
# Key Features
* Introduction of a centralised digital appointment system.
* Standardisation and digitalisation of the Pet Registration process.
* Introduction of a structured file organisation system to prevent misplacement.
* Improve the overall user experience for both staff and pet owners.
# Project Structure
* 01_System-Analysis(&Design).pdf: contains a requirement analysis and design report for the NPC system, including an executive summary, system goals, functional and non-functional requirements, a prioritised UCD, and detailed use case specifications.
* 02_Database-Design&Implementation.pdf: contains the database design and implementation. It includes a top-down ERD, normalisation for the appointment diary, the pet registration form, and the pet consultation form using all stages of the normalisation process (UNF, 1NF, 2NF, 3NF), a merged final ERD, Oracle table creation and data insertion scripts, data retrieval queries with results, and a critical analysis with improvement suggestions.
* 03_Query-Implementation.pdf: contains SQL queries for the NPC system, demonstrating data retrieval and analysis from the designed database. Queries include filtering and sorting pet details, identifying overworked vet doctors, and analysing appointment data.
* database_script.sql: contains the complete SQL script. It provides a functional implementation of the design and can be run in an SQL environment to set up the database.
